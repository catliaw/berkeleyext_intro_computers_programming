# This program sorts using the Bubble Sort algorithm.
# The bubble sort passes through a list of values from start to finish comparing 
# each sequential pair of values. If the values compared are not in order, 
# they are swapped. The sort begins at the start of the list, first comparing 
# the values in position 0 and 1, next the values in positions 1 and 2, 
# then those in positions 2 and 3, and so on until the end of the list is reached. 
# If the entire list is not in the correct order when the sort reaches 
# the end of the list, the sort will start at the beginning of the list and 
# pass through it again. The sort will continue its passes through the list 
# until the list is sorted.
